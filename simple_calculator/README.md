# Python TDD Calculator

## TDD Rules:
1. Test first, code later
2. Add the bare minimum amount of code you need to pass the tests
3. You shouldn't have more than one failing test at a time
4. Write code that passes the test. Then refactor it.
5. A test should fail the first time you run it. If it doesn't ask yourself why you are adding it.
6. Never refactor without tests.
